# Scrimmage maps

This is a repository containing several maps that the community generally plays scrimms on, and are loaded on OCC scrim servers.
If you want a map (or your map) to be added, ask in get in touch with us on discord (https://discord.gg/MZ6xEa7) via `#feedback`.

The maps will be mantained to keep working on upstream PGMDev/PGM.
